 frequency (how frequently they’ve engaged with a brand ) 
 and monetary (how frequently they’ve engaged with a brand. 
 It is a method of using data and segmenting customers based on recency, frequency, and value spent based on current customer behavior to predict the behavior of new customers in the future 
 also It helps to know the size of clients, estimate their value to the business, and create an appropriate marketing strategy.
